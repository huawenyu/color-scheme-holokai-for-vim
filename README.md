# Color Scheme Holokai for Vim

Holokai is inspired by [molokai](http://github.com/tomasr/molokai)
Since I feel the contrast of molokai is too strong for eyes, I tweaked
some colors of it to become the first version of this.

I think Holokai is the best dark theme for VIM on Ubuntu GNOME terminal, which
has a Ubuntu purple color background. Set it to a bit transparent would be
more comfortable.

## Installation
Just copy the files to your .vim folder or use Vundle-like plug-in manager to
do so.

## Note
To use this color scheme under x-terminal, you should enable 256 color support
in both x-terminal and vim and also screen/tmux if you have one.
